    "Having learnt about map projections, and their various trade-offs, we subsequently introduced cartopy's matplotlib interface for handling vector and raster data.\n",

    "We found the ``GeoAxes``'s ``imshow()`` and ``add_geometries()`` methods are just two of the ways of handling raster and vector data respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we looked at a number of approaches and tools that allowed us to interoperate between the two main classes of geospatial data. We used matplotlib, scikit-image, Iris and XArray to work with raster data, and Shapely and Fiona to work with vector data. Whilst most of these tools were never designed to handle Spherical data, cartopy gives us a means to work with it seamlessly."
