    "Having learnt about map projections, and their various trade-offs, we subsequently introduced the `cartopy` `matplotlib` interface for handling vector and raster data.\n",

    "We found the ``GeoAxes``'s ``imshow()`` and ``add_geometries()`` methods are just two of the ways of handling raster and vector data respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we looked at a number of approaches and tools that allowed us to interoperate between the two main classes of geospatial data. We used `matplotlib`, `scikit-image`, `iris` and `xarray` to work with raster data, and `shapely` and `fiona` to work with vector data. Whilst most of these tools were never designed to handle spherical data, `cartopy` gives us a means to work with it seamlessly.\n",
